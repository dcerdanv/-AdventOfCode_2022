    "The expedition comes across a peculiar patch of tall trees all planted carefully in a grid. The Elves explain that a previous expedition planted these trees as a reforestation effort. Now, they're curious if this would be a good location for a [tree house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tree_house).\n",
    "\n",
